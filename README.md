# Feelings
I am enjoying the learning process and undergoing the process of thinking like a developer.
Of note in this assignment is the importance of breaking a problem down by the logical problems we may have and in what order those things need to get accomplished.
If we try to do everything at once, it's a recipe to just get the ring around.  
It's important to take the small victories and recognize that with more practice the complex syntax will come more naturally.
